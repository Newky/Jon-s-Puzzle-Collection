	<h1> Peg Solitaire </h1> 

	<p> Remove all but one peg, finishing with the final peg in the middle of the board. </p>

	<p> Pegs can be removed by jumping them, as in draughts. Only vertical and horizontal moves are allowed; diagonal moves are not allowed. </p>

	<p> Original inspiration for creating this game came from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection</a>. I hope to recreate more of these in Javascript + HTML5 canvas as I learn to program. </p> 

	<p> Code for detecting and correctly placing mouse clicks came from <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/">Dive Into HTML5</a> - an excellent book. </p>
