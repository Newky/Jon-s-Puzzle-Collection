This repository contains Jonathan Roberts' attempt to recreate Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection in Javascript. 

It's not intended to be of much use or interest to anyone other than myself, since I'm using it as an aide to help me learn to code. 

That said, some people on TuxRadar have expressed an interest in collaborating. So, I've created this repository. If you have comments, feedback, or even want to offer some patches, I'd be more than happy to receive them.
